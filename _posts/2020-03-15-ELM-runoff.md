There are many variables related to runoff generated in ELM/CLM. These fluxes are then passed to MOSART with different names, need to be very clear what do they mean.

The hydrologic processes for CLM 4.5 are clearly represented in below diagram. I got it from [Gautam](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/gautam-bisht) but don't know if he made it. (more [here](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/master/html/tech_note/Hydrology/CLM50_Tech_Note_Hydrology.html) for CLM 5).

Basically, the runoff generated by ELM has three parts in a simulation with fixed landuse: 1) surface runoff, 2) subsurface runoff, and 3) glacier, wetland, and lakes (GWL) for water balance.

1) Surface runoff is `qflx_surf` + `qflx_h2osfc_surf` at column level or `qflx_rofliq_qsur_grc` + `qflx_rofliq_qsurp_grc` at grid level. The first term is called "surface runoff", which is excess water from soil saturation (`QOVER` in ELM output); the second term is called surface water runoff, which is the outflow from surface water storage such as pond (`QH2OSFC` in ELM output). It is very confusing by looking at the two names in the output.

2) Subsurface runoff is `qflx_drain` + `qflx_qflx_drain_perched` at column level or `qflx_rofliq_qsub_grc` + `qflx_rofliq_qsubp_grc` at grid level. The first term is called "sub-surface drainage" (`QDRAI` in ELM output); the second term is called "perched wt drainage" (`QDRAI_PERCH` in ELM output). These two terms are pretty straightforward. 

3) GWL runoff (`QRGWL` in ELM output) is the glacier, wetland and lakes water balance residual component which is not routed in MOSART

The sum of the three terms is `QRUNOFF` in ELM output file. These three terms are passed to MOSART for routing and named `QSUR_LIQ`, `QSUB_LIQ`, and `QGWL_LIQ` in MOSART's output file. The fluxes that enters MOSART channels for routing in E3SM V1 are the sum of `QSUR_LIQ` and `QSUB_LIQ` where `QSUR_LIQ` = `ELM-QOVER`+`ELM-QH2OSFC`; `QSUB_LIQ` = `ELM-QDRAI`+`ELM-QDRAI_PERCH`.

If the ELM simulation is a transient run (i.e. the landuse fraction updates every year), then there will be an additional term `QFLX_LIQ_DYNBAL` (liq dynamic land cover change conversion runoff flux) that ensures the water mass conservation when landuse change happens. More details can be found [here](https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/versions/release-clm5.0/html/tech_note/Transient_Landcover/CLM50_Tech_Note_Transient_Landcover.html?highlight=dynamic%20land%20cover#water-and-energy-conservation). Note that this term could introduce negative runoff as well. In this case, `QRUNOFF = QOVER + QH2OSFC + QDRAI + QDRAI_PERCH + QRGWL - QFLX_LIQ_DYNBAL`.

Below is a plot that breaks all the runoff components of a random January in a transient run.

### some other highlights/comments

- In default, irrigation is added directly on the ground, bypassing the canopy.
- There's a elevation standard deviation term (STD_ELEV) in ELM surface data to describe the microtopology in the grid, which is used to dynamically calculate the fraction of surface water storage (FH2OSFC) over the grid.
- CLM 4.5 history field names can be found [here](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.2/clm/models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/history_fields_clm4_5.xml).
- In current hydrology scheme, there's a pre-defined term `qflx_flood` taking flood flux from the river model (RTM) and re-applied it on top of the soil, this can be re-activated when coupling ELM and MOSART in terms of flood inundation. Not sure if we can directly add inundated water into `H2OSFC` here.
