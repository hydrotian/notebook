Sample plotting scripts I normally use. Hope I could constantly update it.

# 1. Matlab

|[<img src="https://simhydro.com/notebook/images/plots/boxplot.png" width="250"/>](https://github.com/hydrotian/plotting/blob/main/matlab/boxplot.m)<br />Grouped boxplots. [Boxchart](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/boxchart.html) might be able to do the same for R2020a afterward. |[<img src="https://simhydro.com/notebook/images/plots/polar.png" width="250"/>](https://github.com/hydrotian/plotting/blob/main/matlab/polar.m)<br />Scatter plot on a map with polar projection. The color and size are scaled to latitude of each dot. This plot requires the awesome [M_Map](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html) package. |
|[<img src="https://simhydro.com/notebook/images/plots/map_low.png" width="250"/>](https://github.com/hydrotian/plotting/blob/main/matlab/map_low.m)<br />A map that utilizes [GSHHG](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/) (formerly called GSHHS) for line features such as rivers and coastal lines as well as [ETOPO1](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/data/ice_surface/grid_registered/binary/), a 1-minute global topography dataset. [More info](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model) about the topological dataset. Addtional [script](https://github.com/hydrotian/plotting/blob/main/matlab/map_high.m) and [rendering](https://simhydro.com/notebook/images/plots/map_high.pdf) for higher resolution. |[<img src="https://simhydro.com/notebook/images/plots/google_map.png" width="250"/>](https://github.com/hydrotian/plotting/blob/main/matlab/google_map.m)<br />A google-type map that generated using [Google Maps API](https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/). Script based on [plot_google_map](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27627-zoharby-plot_google_map). The native resolution (1280X1280) is too low, so I did [a little trick](https://github.com/hydrotian/plotting/blob/main/matlab/google_map_high.m) to grab four images at the same time and stitch them together to increase resolution and details in the map. [Here](https://simhydro.com/notebook/images/plots/google_map_high.png) is the result.|
