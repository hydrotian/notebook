Two tips about iTerm2

## Add a badge to the window

When working with multiple HPCs, it's nice to have the host name printed on each terminal window. To do it, the first step is to install shell integration on each remote host. Simply go to `iTerm2 -> Install Shell Integration -> Download and run installer`. iTerm2 will then run a command line automaticlly. Once it's complete, the next step is adding `\(session.hostname)` in `Badge` under `Profiles -> General`. There are some other contents to show. See [here](https://iterm2.com/3.0/documentation-badges.html).

## Save log-in information for quick connection

You can do it by creating a new profile, then under `Profiles -> General -> Command`, add a `ssh` command. According to [this page](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/419612/does-iterm-or-iterm2-on-mac-allow-storing-host-connections-with-user-password), this seems the only way to do it.
