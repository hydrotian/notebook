Some HPCs such as Argonne's LCRC machines require SSH keys to get connected. It's a convinient and safer way to connect after set it up. But it's a little tricky if you still want to view the remote directories from software like WinSCP on Windows. Here's a brief guide.

## On Mac

Mac is relativly easy. Just follow the instruction to create a public SSH key using OpenSSH and upload it (`id_rsa.pub`) to your account then you can log in from terminal or Microsoft Code. The command is

```linux
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa
```

## On Windows

You can follow the same way above to generate a public SSH key in windows powershell. The generated public key can be used in XShell to get you connected by linking the generated `id_rsa` (not the `id_rsa.pub`) file. You still need to upload the `id_rsa.pub` to your account of course.

For WinSCP it's a little different. You have to connect through a private key generated by PUTTY. The instruction is [here](https://www.lcrc.anl.gov/for-users/getting-started/ssh/putty/). It's nice that WinSCP has a built-in PUTTY key generator which will generate a `.ppk` file instead of a `.pub` file. You will need to upload the OpenSSH style key to the account when it's generated and use the `.ppk` file to login from WinSCP.
