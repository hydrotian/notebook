#### 1. very important websites, containing large number of examples:
http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/

#### 2. to open the notebook:
`ipython notebook`

- to remotely open the notebook, see

http://www.hydro.washington.edu/~jhamman/hydro-logic/blog/2013/10/04/pybook-remote/

#### 3. keep the plots and the code in one page without open and new x-window:
put `%matplotlib inline` at the top of the code.

#### 4. workflow of creating a public web page for your code and plots:
- save the code as .ipynp
- paste the content to GitHub Gist: https://gist.github.com/
- click "get public gist" and get a number
- input this number into http://nbviewer.ipython.org/ and click "go"
example: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/hydro-tian/8461570
