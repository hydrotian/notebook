I need a blog website! This idea suddenly came out when I was learning how to find critical value for bivariate test using Monte Carlo method. After figuring out how to solve my statistical problem, I started to worry about how to memorize the whole process. I think I need a place, a simple, plain web-based place to keep my study and research notes from been forgotten. It has to be fast, easy to access, and functional. Will see how Wordpress blog system works...

Anyway. Hope I can keep on updating this blogÂ and make it an useful reviewing source for myself.

##### update: Now I have migrated my notebook from Wordpress to Github page based on [Jerkyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
