Spent hours debugging a piece of simple script in which I pass more than 9 arguments from outside. Everything's fine for arguments 1-9 but bash couldn't recognize argument 10. Turns out you need to add these damn curly braces on the numbers. Otherwise it will just treat it as $1

Something like this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
 PWD=$1
 BI=$2
 DS=$3
 WS=$4
 EXP=$5
 D2=$6
 D3=$7
 DSMAX=$8
 Inimois2=$9
 Inimois3=${10}  ## here!
```
