# Make 360 deg photos

* Take spherical photo stack by DJI Spark (46 single photos)l

* Download the photos.

* Use Microsoft Image Composite Editor (ICE) to stitch the photos into one photo, save it as jpg file.

* Use Photoshop or other tool to make the photo 2:1. 360 deg photo can't be generated if the ratio is not 2:1. [A nice video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33KGkoBtQSs)

* View it in RICOH THETA viewer to make sure everything is right.

* Modify the projection type of the photo using exiftool. Without this step, the photo will be shown as a flat image in online platforms. 

  `"exiftool(-k).exe" -ProjectionType="equirectangular" photo.jpg`

* Upload it to Facebook or google street view. [An example](https://goo.gl/maps/T1DzZbmQHymRn6xh6)
