# Datasets
### Global Data
- [Global Surface Water dataset](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/download): Tiff data for surface water coverage 1984-2021.
- [Global Long-term River Width (GLOW)](https://zenodo.org/record/6425657): 1984-2020 Global river width.
- [GloFAS-ERA5](https://www.globalfloods.eu/): 0.1 degree daily time step global routed streamflow, ERA5 runoff + LISFLOOD river discharge
- [GRFR runoff](https://www.reachhydro.org/home/records/grfr): Global Reach-level Flood Reanalysis(GRFR). We sometimes call it "Ming Pan's runoff". It is well-calibrated 0.05 degree VIC output at daily and 3-hrly resolution from 1980 to 2019. It includes both runoff and streamflow.
- [LORA runoff](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/23/851/2019/): Linear Optimal Runoff Aggregate (LORA). A global gridded runoff product available at monthly timescales, and includes time-variant uncertainty, for the period 1980–2012 on a 0.5 degree grid
- [Dominant River Tracing (DRT)](https://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/drt.php): Global eight-direction flow network developed by Huan Wu, ranging from 1/16th deg to 2 deg.
- [ICOLD database](https://www.icold-cigb.org/GB/World_register/data_search.asp): International Commission On Large Dams (ICOLD) provides global dam information
- [GRanD database](https://www.globaldamwatch.org/grand/): The initial version 1.1 of Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD) contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 km3.
- [LEGOS Water level database](http://www.legos.obs-mip.fr/en/soa/hydrologie/hydroweb/index.html): LEGOS provides time series over water levels of large rivers, lakes and wetlands around the world. 

### Regional Data
- [USGS National Water Information System](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/): Where you download USGS gauge data
- [Colorado River Data](http://www.water-data.com/): Colorado River water related information
- [SMAP-HydroBlocks](https://waterai.earth/smaphb/): It is a hyper-resolution satellite-based surface soil moisture product at 30-m resolution over the continental United States (2015-2019).
- [R-ArcticNET](https://www.r-arcticnet.sr.unh.edu/v4.0/index.html): Pan-Arctic streamflow data
- [GridMet](https://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html): It is a dataset of daily high-spatial resolution (~4-km, 1/24th degree) surface meteorological data covering the contiguous US from 1979-yesterday.
- [AKTEMP](https://aktemp.uaa.alaska.edu/#/explorer): It is a cloud-based database platform for storing and accessing stream and lake temperature monitoring data across Alaska.
- [NID](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/): National Inventory of Dams (NID) provides >90,000 dams information in the US
